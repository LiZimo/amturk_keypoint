<font color="blue">Human-object contact points</font> are the usual places on an object where a human touches an object when they interacts with it in a particular action mode.  Different action modes can potentially mean different contact points for the same object.

In this task we ask you to highlight contact points on an object for a particular action. Below are example correct clicks for <font color="blue">hand</font> contact points for a human <font color="purple">riding</font> a <font color="red">bicycle</font>.   Note that your goal is to click on typical <font color="blue">hand</font> contact points (i.e., bicycle handles) even if they are occluded by a human hand, or a person is touching a bicycle at a different region, or if there is no person at all.

<p>If contact points are occluded (e.g., covered up by <font color="blue">hands</font>) still click on the most likely location in the image.</p>

<!-- <p>Even if the human within the image is not touching the <font color="blue"> hand contact </font> point associated with the action <font color="purple">riding</font> with his <font color="blue"> hand </font>, please click the proper contact point for the action on the object anyway.  </p> -->
<p>If the person is not riding a bicycle or rides it in an unusual way, still click on typical contact points if a person were to ride a bicycle (i.e., bicycle handles in the example above)</p>

<!-- <p>Even if no human is present in the image at all, please click where the human <i>would</i> contact the object with his <font color = "blue"> hand </font> for the action <font color = "purple"> riding </font>.</p> -->
<p>Click on typical contact points even if there is no person riding the bicycle.</p>

<p>Even if the human is touching the object somewhere else other than the <font color="blue"> hand </font> contact point for the action <font color="purple">riding</font>, click the contact points for the appropriate action and not where the human is actually touching the object.</p>

<p>Even if the human is contacting the object correctly for the given action mode, but not touching all correct contact points, please label all contact points anyway. </p>

<p>If the contact points are unclear, out of frame, or you cannot select them for any other reason, please check the 
<font color = "orange">Cannot Complete</font> box.  Please only use this option as a final resort.  Erroneously clicking this box means you will NOT get paid.  Very few images, if any, should have this box clicked on.</p>
