<font color="blue">Human-object contact points</font> are the usual places on an object where a human touches an object when they interacts with it in a particular action mode.  Different action modes can potentially mean different contact points for the same object.

In this task we ask you to highlight contact points on an object for a particular action. Below are example correct clicks for <font color="blue">hand</font> contact points for a human carrying a <font color="red">suitcase</font>.   Note that your goal is to click on typical <font color="blue">hand</font> contact points (i.e., suitcase hand-holders) even if they are occluded by a human hand, or a person is touching a suitcase at a different region than the usual contact-points, or if there is no person at all.

<p>If contact points are occluded (e.g., covered up by <font color="blue">hand</font>) still click on the most likely location in the image.</p>

<!-- <p>Even if the human within the image is not touching the <font color="blue"> hand contact </font> point associated with the action <font color="purple">riding</font> with his <font color="blue"> hand </font>, please click the proper contact point for the action on the object anyway.  </p> -->
<p>If the person is not interacting with a suitcase, still click on typical contact points if a person were to interact with a suitcase (i.e., suitcase handles in the example above)</p>

<!-- <p>Even if no human is present in the image at all, please click where the human <i>would</i> contact the object with his <font color = "blue"> hand </font> for the action <font color = "purple"> riding </font>.</p> -->
<p>Click on typical contact points even if there is no contact between the two.</p>

<p>If the contact points are unclear, out of frame, or you cannot select them for any other reason, please check the 
<font color = "orange">Cannot Complete</font> box.  Please only use this option as a final resort.  Erroneously clicking this box means you will NOT get paid.  Very few images, if any, should have this box clicked on.</p>
